			/RageSpline/Demo/Template - Physics Game
			/RageSpline/Demo/Template - Top-down Game
		* To start creating your own RageSpline shapes, drag one of the 
		bundled prefabs (RageSpline\Prefabs) to your scene and use it as a starting point.

	## Important commands:

	*Double-click = Add new control point to closest segment of selected RageSpline
	*Del or backspace = Delete selected control point (tries to preserve curvature)
	*N = Switch selected control point between natural(smooth) and sharp
	*H = Hide/Show Point Handle Gizmos (makes moving points easier) 
	*I = Invert Fill and Stroke colors
	*K = Shrink outline width at selected point
	*L = Grow outline width at selected point
	*SHIFT = Control point multiselect. Keep holding it down and drag with mouse to move

	## Precision Movement and Alignment: 
	1. Enable Snapping (Local or World)
	2. Select Multiple Points
	3. Copy desired coordinate to all X or Y point values
